# OJ START HERE — AISPORE (SSOT pointer)

Last updated: 2026-02-10

If you are reading this in a new browser/chat:
1) Open AISPORE_STATE.md first (repo root) — it is the SSOT top-level summary.
2) Then read:
   - memory/state.md (current verified status)
   - memory/decisions.md (locked decisions, non-negotiables)
   - memory/project.md (big picture + “done means”)

Current mode:
- v1 runnable skeleton
- Focus only: ticket calc → raffle → reward lock (admin) → readback (public)
- Weekly lock idempotency verified
- Telegram/badges/snake untouched

Ports:
- API: 3100 (src/api)
- WEB: 3000 (web/ai-spore-site) with /api/* rewrite to API

Rule:
- No new ideas. Only verify, lock, commit, update SSOT.
