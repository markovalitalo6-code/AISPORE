# OJ_START_HERE — AISPORE SSOT

## PROJECT
AISPORE v1 — web-first community **hold & participation** system (Solana)

## CURRENT MODE
v1 runnable skeleton. Focus only:
ticket calc → raffle → reward lock → readback

## LOCKED FACTS
- HOLDING = PARTICIPATION (no staking, no ROI/yield language)
- Treasury-first, never drains
- Probabilistic ticket-based rewards
- Anti-whale / anti-sybil protections
- Web is SSOT, Telegram only announces/routes

## DO NOT TOUCH
- build/specs/*LOCKED* (LOCKED spec)
- treasury formulas / caps logic
- reward lock logic (idempotency / seed immutability)

## NEXT STEP
Create SSOT-only memory docs (PROJECT_MAP + ACTIVE_CONTEXT) and push **docs-only** commit to GitHub.
